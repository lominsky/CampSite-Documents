	<li style="margin:5px 0">Staff members <strong>MUST</strong> submit a medical report, dated within the last 12 months and including tuberculin test to the director (address posted above) no later than <strong>June 15th</strong> as a protective health measure. Staff members who were employed by Shire Village Camp during the summer of 2015 and who provided the camp with a full medical report for that summer do not need to submit a form. Please note that staff members who have worked as employees at Shire Village Camp for more than 2 consecutive summers must submit a new and complete medical report every other summer. <strong>Staff members who do not have the required medical form will not be allowed to begin work.</strong> Only staff members hired 3 weeks or less before the start of work may receive a physical at camp. Children of staff members must have their medical forms completed before arrival at camp.</li>
	<li style="margin:5px 0">The employee is covered under a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Insurance Policy, which covers medical expenses for accidents occurring in the course and pursuit of employment. In addition, $30.00 will be deducted from each employee&#39;s first week&#39;s salary to cover medical insurance (whether or not the employee has a private plan). Any medical expenses, including medications, not covered under Workmen&#39;s Compensation Policy shall be borne by the employee and the employer shall have no responsibility for such expenses. All medications needed for pre-existing conditions are the sole responsibility of the employee. They will not be paid for by Shire Village.</li>
	<li style="margin:5px 0">The employer reserves the right to withhold $15.00 (or more) or the employee&#39;s salary to be used to defray personal expenses believed to have been incurred by the employee. The employer will refund the unused portion of this amount within three (3) months after camp closes.</li>
	<li style="margin:5px 0">The employee&#39;s laundry may be included with the camper&#39;s weekly laundry; otherwise it is the sole responsibility of the employee. If done by camp, camp is not responsible for loss or damage.</li>

	<li style="margin:5px 0">The employer may dismiss the employee at any time during the camping season, without notice, for the employee&#39;s failure to live up to the terms and conditions of employment, set by the employer, or for any other good cause as determined by the employer. In the event of a dismissal, the employer shall have no responsibility to the employee, except as indicated in item 7. Any employee dismissed by the employer is not to visit camp for the remainder of the summer and must leave camp within the timeframe determined by the director.</li>
	<li style="margin:5px 0">In the event that camp is diminished in enrollment or cannot open due to circumstances beyond the control of the employer, this agreement shall be null and void and of no force and effect. In the event of curtailment of the camp season for any reason whatsoever, the employer will pay the employee a pro-rata share of the salary referred to in item 7 for services performed to the date of curtailment.</li>
	<li style="margin:5px 0">The employee grants the employer the right to use the employee&#39;s picture in any camp publication or publicity release and the employee hereby grants the employer the right to quote from any written report or material written by the employee for camp use.</li>
	<li style="margin:5px 0">Shire Village Camp is run on a non-competitive, inclusive, and humanitarian basis. The employer interprets this to mean that the use of threats, shame, or physical violence towards any person at camp would be contrary to these principles. We create a welcoming, respectful, inclusive, and supportive community for all campers, families, and staff. With these ideas in mind, we are committed to providing a safe and caring community for transgender families, campers, and staff. The employee agrees to adhere to this philosophy and abide by it, and to try to guide campers at all times with patience, kindness, and fairness. Staff will attend training sessions related to camp philosophy during the summer.</li>
